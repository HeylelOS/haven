.SH NAME
.PP
Create Makefile rules.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
hvn-mkgen [-S sources] [-d dependencies] [filename]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The program will analyze the hierarchy under sources, and for each module create a link target.Each module is either considered a library or an executable, depending on whether they are prefixed with lib or not. Then, each file which has a rule associated with its extension is created a target. The target is the name of the source, with the extension replaced with .o. Note that two files with the same basenames will create a target collision!
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
-S : Sources, where to look up for modules, by default src.
